\begin{abstract}
  Recent advances in Machine Learning and Data Mining enable new
  branches of educational research to thrive, particularly e-learning and data
  capturing through e-learning systems. \cite{romero2010educational}
  Academic performance research benefits strongly from this trend
  through better predictive models. In this paper,
  I investigate \textbf{hierarchical models} - a flexible family of advanced
  parametric models - that could achieve not only high out-of-sample prediction
  power but also meaningful confidence intervals for statistical
  inference. Reviews and empirical comparisons versus traditional machine
  learning methods on an educational dataset are also provided in details.

\section{Historical review of Education research}
The paper briefly compares the evolution of quantitative predictive methods in
education research to motivate interest in advanced parametric methods.

\subsection{Parametric Statistical Models}
Traditionally, research in education and educational
policies have applied similar quantitative methods to those used in the social sciences
\cite{gelman2009quantitative}, because the main goal of these
educational inquiries is to \textbf{establish causal effects}. \textbf{Parametric}, sparse models which allow ease of \textbf{hypothesis testing}
therefore are both prevalent and important, while black-box,
flexible predictive models are not popular. \cite{teo2014handbook}

Some parametric models offer \textbf{prediction capability} with 
\textbf{confidence intervals (CIs)}. However, unlike causality testing, prediction only take secondary roles in traditional education research,
so these models are not built to optimize for \textbf{out-of-sample accuracy}. \cite{romero2010educational}.

\subsection{Recent Machine learning methods}
Advances in Machine Learning enable new
branches of educational research to thrive, particularly \textbf{intelligent learning systems}. \cite{romero2010educational}
New ways of generating data and richer features through e-learning systems enable researchers to build better predictive models. People apply more modern methods on these datasets, and
\textbf{ensembles, neural nets} and \textbf{SVMs} are the most common methods
when optimizing for \textbf{out-of-sample accuracy}. \cite{shahiri2015review}, \cite{amrieh2016mining} 

The body of work that apply predictive ML methods
on educational data tends to \textit{weight practicality more than interpretability}, and
they optimize for overall predictive accuracy instead of answering traditional inference questions. \cite{romero2010educational, meier2016predicting}

\section{Research goal and methodology}
Could we build flexible predictive models
that offer \textit{not only high out-of-sample prediction
  power but also meaningful confidence intervals for statistical
  inference.}? A family of advanced parametric models that could satisfy this
demand is \textbf{hierarchical models} - we will investigate their construction
process and predictive power in this paper.

\subsection{Hierarchical modeling}
Hierarchical models offer a balance between 
predictive accuracy and interpretability. \textit{\textbf{Hierarchical models are particularly suitable for
educational research, because education data are generally collected
from a hierarchy.}} \cite{
skrondal2009prediction, kaplan2016causal} 

For example, you can have performance
scores for students in a
state, at different districts, different schools within the same district, different
class levels within the same school etc. Of course, if the data are generated in
a true controlled fashion with balanced groups representation across all
covariates, then we can just do a pooled t-test, but these are survey or
longitudinal data with known \textbf{biases} and \textbf{imbalances}. \cite{konig2017bayesian}

There are few studies focusing on \textit{hierarchical models in academic performance}
\cite{tsai2015hierarchical, subedi2015measuring}, and there is no current study that focuses
on building a highly predictive hierarchical model first before interpreting
statistical significance.

\subsection{Bayesian Techniques in Hierarchical modeling}
Fitting hierarchical model is one of the
major usage of \textbf{Bayesian techniques}. Previously, due to
computational complexity of the sampling algorithms in these Bayesian techniques, building hierarchical models are hard.
However, recent advances in hardware and software have opened up these techniques to a wider range of social science problems. \cite{carpenter2017stan}

\subsection{Comparison of modeling techniques}
In coming sections, this research builds hierarchical models on a student
performance dataset
and compares those hierarchical models' predictive power against
state-of-the-art tree-based models built on the same data.

\section{Exploratory data analysis}
\section{Data overview}

The educational dataset in \cite{amrieh2016mining} is collected from a learning management system (LMS) using an activity tracker. This learning system monitors learning progress like reading an article or watching a training video. 

The data consist of \textbf{480 student records} and \textbf{17 features}, with final performance as the desired predictive outcome - \ref{fig:gender_outcome}. 

\subsection{Features}
The features are classified into three major categories:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Demographic: gender and nationality etc. - Fig. \ref{fig:gender_outcome}, \ref{fig:nationality_fig}
	\item Academic: topic, grade level and section etc. - Fig. \ref{fig:topic_bar}
	\item Behavioral: raised hand on class, visited resources, answering survey by parents, and school satisfaction - Fig \ref{fig:vresources_outcome}
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/gender_outcome.png}
		\caption{
			Women tend to perform better than men on average.
		}~\label{fig:gender_outcome}	
	
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/nationality_bar.png}
	\caption{
		The students come from different origins: 179 are from Kuwait, 172 are from Jordan, and smaller groups < 30 from Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunis, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria etc.
}~\label{fig:nationality_fig}


	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/topic_bar.png}
	\caption{
		Multiple topics included - this feature is also unbalanced.
	}~\label{fig:topic_bar}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/vresources_outcome.png}
	\caption{
		Tendency to visit resources is a \textit{behavioral feature} - only made available by E-learning systems. This plot shows that students who received a lower grade (L) visited fever resources than students that scored a M or H grade. Additionally, women who received a high mark (H) almost exclusively visited a lot of the on-line resources.
	}~\label{fig:vresources_outcome}	
\end{figure}


\subsection{Reference tree-based models}
Reference state-of-the-art tree-based models are taken from \textbf{Amrieh
et. al.} \cite{amrieh2016mining}, where the authors built learners on this data and show that ensemble
models achieve strong out-of-sample prediction. I reproduced their results using \textbf{25pct} of data as hold-out test set with accuracy listed in table TODO:


\subsection{Shortcomings of tree-based/black-box methods}
For inference, the predicted values from tree-based/black-box models do not provide useful
information that aids decision making, e.g. confidence intervals and
significance of contributing factors. 
\cite{efron2016computer, meier2016predicting} E.g, by topic, the dataset in
\cite{amrieh2016mining} is unbalanced (\textbf{Fig. \ref{fig:topic_bar}}): \textbf{IT} has 95 students
vs. \textbf{Maths} has 21 students, so performance prediction for a new Maths
student should be a lot less certain than that of a new IT
student. Meanwhile, none of the blackbox models can reflect such confidence
adjustments based on their predictive values.

of equal length.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/sigchi-logo}
  \caption{Insert a caption below each figure. Do not alter the
    Caption style.  One-line captions should be centered; multi-line
    should be justified. }~\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by last name of first author, and referenced by numbers
in
brackets~\cite{acm_categories,ethics,Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378}.
Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Borriello, personal communication]'').

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}. This

\end{table}

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold,
all in capitals. Sections should \textit{not} be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold
with initial letters capitalized.  For sub-sections and
sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of} is not
capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point
italic with initial letters capitalized.  Standard
\texttt{{\textbackslash}section}, \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsection},
and \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsubsection} commands will work fine in
this template.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.75\columnwidth]{figures/map}
  \caption{In this image, the map maximizes use of space. You can make
    figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of
    both columns. Note that \LaTeX\ tends to render large figures on a
    dedicated page. Image: \ccbynd~ayman on
    Flickr.}~\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure*}

Captions should be Times New Roman or Times Roman 9-point bold.  They
should be numbered (e.g., ``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or
``Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}''), centered and placed beneath the figure
or table.  Please note that the words ``Figure'' and ``Table'' should
be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure'' rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they
occur. Figures, like Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, may span columns and
all figures should also include alt text for improved accessibility.
Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in
the proceedings.

The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure up to five
minutes in length. However, the paper should stand on its own without
the video figure, as the video may not be available to everyone who
reads the paper.  

\subsection{Inserting Images}
When possible, include a vector formatted graphic (i.e. PDF or EPS).
When including bitmaps,  use an image editing tool to resize the image
at the appropriate printing resolution (usually 300 dpi).

\section{Quotations}
Quotations may be italicized when \textit{``placed inline''} (Anab,
23F).

\begin{quote}
Longer quotes, when placed in their own paragraph, need not be
italicized or in quotation marks when indented (Ramon, 39M).  
\end{quote}

\section{Language, Style, and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consis- tently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Add tags to the PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see: \url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}.  The
\texttt{{\textbackslash}hyperref} package allows you to create well tagged PDF files,
please see the preamble of this template for an example.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission should not contain footer or header information
at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, your final submission
should not include page numbers. Initial submissions may include page
numbers, but these must be removed for camera-ready. Page numbers will
be added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

When creating your PDF from Word, ensure that you generate a tagged
PDF from improved accessibility. This can be done by using the Adobe
PDF add-in, also called PDFMaker. Select Acrobat | Preferences from
the ribbon and ensure that ``Enable Accessibility and Reflow with
tagged Adobe PDF'' is selected. You can then generate a tagged PDF by
selecting ``Create PDF'' from the Acrobat ribbon.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years' proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.
